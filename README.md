# BlenderSpiky ⚡⚡

This is **BlenderSpiky** adapted from [BlenderSpike](https://github.com/ArtemKirsanov/BlenderSpike/tree/main)

First of all, huge shoutout to ArtemKirsanov, he made the NEURON to Blender module.

## Graphing
I added the **new graphing system**:

Now you can get some great looking graphs within Blender!

The graph elements are very customizable and easy in use.
