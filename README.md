This is BlenderSpiky adapted from BlenderSpike.
First of all, huge shoutout to ArtemKirsanov, he made the NEURON to Blender module.

I added the **new graphing system**.
Now you don't need to exit blender to get some great looking graphs of any NEURON section you desire. 
The graph elements are very customizable and easy in use.

## Installation
- First Install Blender: https://www.blender.org/download/

Then install the addon (see video below)
- Download the latest `BlenderSpiky.zip` from the Releases section 
- Add the addon in Blender
